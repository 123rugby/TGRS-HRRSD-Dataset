TGRS-HRRSD-Dataset
=====================
This is the object detection dataset proposed in my recent work 

> **"Hierarchical and Robust Convolutional Neural Network for Very High Resolution Remote Sensing Object Detection"** 
> on **IEEE TGRS**. 

This dataset contains about 20k images with different size and 4k objects for each of the 13 categories.
