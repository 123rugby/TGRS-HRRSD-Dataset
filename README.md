TGRS-HRRSD-Dataset: High Resolution Remote Sensing Detection
=====================
This is the object detection dataset proposed in my recent work 

> **"Hierarchical and Robust Convolutional Neural Network for Very High Resolution Remote Sensing Object Detection"** 
> on **IEEE TGRS**. 

This dataset contains 21761 images with different sizes and about 4k objects for each of the 13 categories.
